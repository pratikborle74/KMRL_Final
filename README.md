## 🎯 Problem Statement

KMRL must decide nightly which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service, remain on standby, or undergo maintenance. This decision involves **6 interdependent variables**:

1. **Fitness Certificates** - Rolling-Stock, Signalling & Telecom validity windows
2. **Job-Card Status** - IBM Maximo work orders (open vs. closed)
3. **Branding Priorities** - Contractual advertising exposure commitments  
4. **Mileage Balancing** - Component wear equalization across fleet
5. **Cleaning & Detailing** - Resource-constrained maintenance slots
6. **Stabling Geometry** - Physical bay optimization for minimal shunting

Currently managed through manual spreadsheets and WhatsApp updates in a compressed 21:00-23:00 IST window, this process is **error-prone, non-repeatable, and doesn't scale** to KMRL's planned 40 trainsets by 2027.
